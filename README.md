# Animal-Typing-Test
It's a fun, minimalist desktop typing app built with Python and CustomTkinter. Type your way through randomly chosen (sus) paragraphs, get judged (gently) based on your speed, and be awarded one of three animal icons:
🐅 Fast typers = Tiger  
🐈 Average = Cat  
🦕 Slow? Dino mode

Track your WPM, count your mistakes, and reset anytime to try again!
